HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and
combined community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.
